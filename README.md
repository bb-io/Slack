## Introduction

<!-- begin docs -->

Slack is a messaging app for businesses that improves communication, teamwork, and decision-making. It allows people to collaborate easily, work on their own time, and share information in dedicated chat spaces.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that you have a Slack account and you are part of a specific workspace.

### Enable webhooks

If you want to use Slack webhooks, you'll need to add Blackbird bot to the channels you're interested in after you've created a connection. There are two ways to do this.

The first way:

- Select a channel.
- Send a message with _@Blackbird_ content.
- Click _Add to channel_.
- Do the same for other channels you're interested in.

The second way:

- Go to the channel you selected during connection creation.
- Find _added an integration to this channel: Blackbird_ message.
- Click on _Blackbird_ -> _Add this app to a channel..._ -> select a channel from dropdown.
- Do the same for other channels you're interested in.

## Actions

### Messages

- **Send message** sends a message to a Slack channel. Add a text message, attachments or both. Optionally send the message in a thread
- **Get message** returns message information, including attachments if it has any
- **Delete message**
- **Send scheduled message**
- **Update message**

### Reactions

- **Add reaction** adds a reaction to a message.
- **Remove reaction** removes a reaction from a message.
- **Get reactions** lists all reactions for a single message.

### Channels

- **Create channel**

### Users

- **Get all users** retrieves a list of users in a Slack team.
- **Get user information**.
- **Get user by email**.
- **Get user profile**.
- **Get team**.

## Events

- **On message** is triggered when any new message is sent to a channel. This event has a parameter _Trigger on message replies_ which is _False_ by default. If you want your bird to trigger on channel messages and message replies, set this parameter to _True_. If you use **On channel message** with **Send message in thread** in a single flow, you should set _Trigger on message replies_ to _False_ or leave it unspecified to avoid an infinite loop. If you want your bird to trigger only when a message has file attachments, set the _Trigger only when message has files_ to _True_, default is _False_.
- **On app mentioned** is triggered when the app is mentioned (@Blackbird). Useful to create workflow triggers that only start when specifically invoked by a user through Slack.
- **On member joined channel**.
- **On reaction added**. Can be configured to a specific channel and a specific emoji.

## Example

![Example](image/README/example-1.png)

![Example-2](image/README/example-2.png)

Here, whenever a new message with attachments is sent, we receive files by `Get message` action, iterate over them and send them to **Google Drive** using `Upload file` action.
